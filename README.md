How Does Market Basket Analysis Work?<br>
It uses association rule mining with an IF, THEN construct.<br>
Example association rule: “Bread” ➡️ “Butter.”<br>
Definitions:<br>
Antecedent: The “IF” element (e.g., bread).<br>
Consequent: The item(s) encountered along with the antecedent (e.g., butter).<br>
